          <h2>How Popular is The Philippines Among Tourists?</h2>
          <p>
            Is Philippines still a worthy travel destination? We visualized the
            current state of tourism in the Philippines using public available
            data from 2014 to 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            We analyzed which countries often visit the Philippines. Asia
            supplies the highest proportion of visitors, led by South Korea and
            Japan which together with the USA accounted for almost half of the
            total in 2008. The importance of Philippine passport holders
            permanently residing abroad, excluding overseas workers, should not
            be overlooked (DOT, 2009a).
          </p>
          <p>
            There were around 5.5M tourists visiting the Philippines annually
            since 2014. Using the data from Department of Tourism, we were able
            to identify and visualize origin of tourist. We also learned which
            countries where most tourists were coming from.

              Almost 50% of the tourists to the Philippines, come from
              neighboring Asian coutries. Tourists from Africa are almost
              non-existent. Philippines being an archipelago are mainly reached
              via air traffic. International ferry and cruise ship arrival
              numbers are presently insignificant compared to over 40 million
              international arrivals. As self-reported by the airline passengers
              on the immigrations slips (country of origin, purpose of the
              visit) are the most reliable data regarding inbound tourism.
            </p>

              Based on 2016 data, following points are evident:

              Map of the most popular destinations with the volumes of traffic
              to the Philippines. Through a scatter map, we pinpoint locations
              that relatively have a number of tourists both in domestic (local)
              and foreign origins. The larger circles represent higher volumes.

              As you can see, the number of domestic tourists visually weighs
              more than the foreign tourists. There were also some noticeable
              differences between the tourists between where foreign and
              domestic tourists preferred tourist destinations.

            <p>
              Davao City is the most visited destination for local tourists
              while Lapulapu City is the most popular among foreign tourists.
              Both destinations are not popular.
